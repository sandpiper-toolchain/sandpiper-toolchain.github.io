## Workshop Concludes, Community Closer to Consensus

The recent [Launching sandpiper workshop](/workshops/launch) brought together more than 50 scientists and engineers working in geomorphology and sedimentology to discuss the future of open-source hardware and software in the field. 
By all accounts, the workshop was a huge success.

Participants from various backgrounds came together to discuss and debate the key elements of a standardized approach to data preparation, bringing the community significantly closer to a consensus on what an analysis-ready data standard should look like.

Beyond data standards, attendees also dedicated significant time to brainstorming the potential design and benefits of a modular open-source hardware system tailored for physical experiments.

This collaborative effort toward hardware and data standardization is crucial for streamlining data analysis workflows and ensuring interoperability across different research groups and projects. 
The workshop also gave attention to this subject, considering the development and adoption of open-source analysis software.

The energy and engagement throughout the workshop highlighted the importance of the sandpiper toolchain for the future of open science in geomorphology and sedimentology.
